title: "2025 ACM SIGMETRICS: Call for Student Posters"
timestamp: "4/24/2025 6:17:17"
---
We invite students to present their work in the Student Poster Session at ACM SIGMETRICS 2025, together with the conference reception. Those presenting a poster will also receive partial financial support for travel; see below for details.

To participate, a student must submit a 2-page abstract of their original research project. The abstract will be lightly reviewed by the two co-chairs. The content of the presented poster can be an idea with preliminary results, ongoing work, or submitted/published work. The abstract will not be included in Sigmetrics proceedings, so authors retain all copyright.

Submit your work and present your research at SIGMETRICS 2025!

===Detailed Submission Requirement===

The submission must be written in English and must be submitted as a PDF file. All submissions must conform to the Alternate ACM SIG Proceedings Paper Formatting Guidelines (LaTEX users must use the class file).

The abstract is to be submitted electronically using the HotCRP submission page: https://sigmetrics25poster.hotcrp.com/.

===Important Dates===

Poster Submission Deadline: May 2nd, 2025 at 11:59:59 pm (midnight) AoE
Poster Acceptance Notification: May 5th, 2025

===Travel Grant and Financial Support===

Students with posters accepted will receive limited financial support towards travel costs, assuming they do not already have a travel grant. This support will be in the form of a reimbursement which will be done after the conference. The number and amount of the financial support will depend on the number of poster applications and the available funds.
