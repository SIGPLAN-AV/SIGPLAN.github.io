                        CALL FOR PAPERS

              https://2025.ecoop.org/home/gpce-2025

===================================================================

The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming:
Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a programming languages conference
focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language
implementation, and product-line development. This is the 24th
edition of the conference, co-located with the ECOOP 2025
conference in Bergen, Norway.

======================== Topics of Interest ========================

GPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical
contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not
limited to:

* program transformation, staging,
* macro systems, preprocessors,
* program synthesis,
* code-recommendation systems,
* domain-specific languages,
* generative language workbenches,
* language embedding, language design,
* domain engineering,
* software product lines, configurable software,
* feature interactions,
* applications and properties of code generation,
* language implementation,
* AI/ML techniques for generative programming,
* generative programming for AI/ML techniques,
* low code / no code approaches.

GPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and
software development and among different styles of generative
programming in its broadest sense.

Authors are welcome to check with the PC chair whether their
planned papers are in scope.

======================== Paper Categories =========================

GPCE solicits four kinds of submissions:

Full Papers:
  reporting original and unpublished results of research that
  contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topics. Full
  paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the
  bibliography.

Short Papers:
  presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE
  topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in
  the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the
  community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not
  intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are
  included in the proceedings and will be presented at the
  conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages
  excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Short
  Paper)” appended to their titles.

Tool Demonstrations:
  presenting tools for any GPCE topics. Tools must be available for
  use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a
  tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and
  a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not
  exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the
  text “(Tool Demonstration)” appended to their titles. If they are
  accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the
  proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used for
  evaluating the submission.

Generative Pearls:
  are elegant essays about generative programming. Examples include
  but are not limited to an interesting application of generative
  programming and an elegant presentation of a (new or old) data
  structure using generative programming (similar to Functional
  Pearl in ICFP and Pearl in ECOOP). Accepted Generative Pearl
  papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at
  the conference. Generative Pearl submissions must not exceed 12
  pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text
  “(Generative Pearl)” appended to their titles.

========================= Paper Selection =========================

The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according
to the following selection criteria:

Novelty.
  Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them
  appropriately within the context established by previous research
  in the field.

Significance.
  The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the
  state of the art or practice in significant ways.

Evidence.
  The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples
  of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented
  systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case
  studies.

Clarity.
  The paper must present its contributions and results clearly.
