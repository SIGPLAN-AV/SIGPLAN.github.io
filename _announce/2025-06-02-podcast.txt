Current Continuation is a new interview series where we talk to researchers in
the field of programming languages. Your hosts are the co-editors of the
SIGPLAN blog, Aws Albarghouthi (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Adrian
Sampson (Cornell).

The first two episodes are out now, with Ranjit Jhala and Satnam Singh. We'll
publish a few more ahead of PLDI.
