FROM 2025 - 9th Working Formal Methods Symposium  
September 17-19, 2025, Iași, România

The Working Formal Methods Symposium (FROM) aims to bring together
researchers and practitioners working on formal methods by
contributing new theoretical results, methods, techniques, frameworks,
and/or by creating or using software tools that apply theoretical
contributions. The program includes invited lectures and regular
contributions. 

Organizers:

  Verimag, CNRS, University of Grenoble Alpes
  Faculty of Computer Science, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iași

Important Dates

  Paper/abstract submission deadline: June 7, 2025
  Author notification: July 15, 2025
  Revised paper/abstract submission deadline: August 29, 2025
  Registration deadline: September 2, 2025

Submissions

Papers of up to 16 pages prepared according to the EPTCS template
(https://style.eptcs.org/) must be submitted electronically using the
EasyChair submission system
(https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=from2025). Research papers
must contain original research results not submitted or published
elsewhere. 
Selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the
   Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming),
 subject to formal approval by Elsevier. 

Authors wishing to present work in progress or survey previous
