Call for Papers

Workshop on Virtual Machines and Language Implementations (VMIL’25)
Co-located with SPLASH 2025
October 12-18, 2025, Singapore

https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/vmil-2025

========================================================================
The concept of Virtual Machines is pervasive in the design and implementation of
programming systems. Virtual Machines and the languages they implement are
crucial in the specification, implementation and/or user-facing deployment of
most programming technologies.
The VMIL workshop is a forum for researchers and cutting-edge practitioners in
language virtual machines, the intermediate languages they use, and related
issues.
The workshop is intended to be welcoming to a wide range of topics and
perspectives, covering all areas relevant to the workshop’s theme. Aspects of
interest include, but are not limited to:

- design issues in VMs and IRs (e.g. IR design, VM modularity, polyglotism);
  compilation (static and dynamic compilation strategies, optimizations, data
- representations);
- memory management;
- security considerations;
- concurrency (both internal and user-facing);
- performance engineering;
- tool support and related infrastructure (profiling, debugging, liveness, persistence);
- the experience of VM development (use of high-level languages, bootstrapping
  and self-hosting, reusability, portability, developer tooling, etc.);
- empirical studies on related topics, such as usage patterns,
  the usability of languages or tools, experimental methodology, or benchmark design;
- the use of VMs in teaching programming, programming languages, and programming
  language implementation.

Submission Guidelines

----------

Submission Categories
==========

We invite high-quality papers in the following two categories:

- **Research and experience papers**: These submissions should describe work
    that advances the current state of the art in the above or related areas.

- **Work-in-progress or position papers**: These papers should document ongoing
    efforts in an area of interest which have not yet yielded final results,
    and/or should present and defend the authors’ position on a topic related to
    the broad area of the workshop.


Additionally, this year, we invite “Experimental Setups” papers in both research
and work-in-progress paper categories.

Experimental setups
==========

As experiments in our field become increasingly challenging due to the growing
complexity of software and hardware stacks, we aim to support researchers in
preparing their experimental setups, which often demand significant engineering
efforts. Therefore, we invite the submission of experimental setups to receive
feedback. Such submissions should briefly discuss what the experiments are meant
to show and then describe the experimental setup, but should explicitly not discuss
any results. We recommend the format of both research and work-in-progress
papers for such submissions.

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE**: If authors intend to submit their papers as experimental
  setups, please check the relevant checkbox in HotCRP before submitting your
  paper.

Submissions
==========

For the first submission deadline, all paper types are considered for
publication in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be
included. Publication of work-in-progress and experimental setups papers at VMIL
is not intended to preclude later publication elsewhere.

Submissions will be judged on novelty, clarity, timeliness, relevance, and
potential to stimulate discussion during the workshop. As the review process is
double blind, please ensure all author names are redacted when submitting for
review.

For the second deadline, we will consider only work-in-progress and position
papers. Abstracts do not have to be submitted before the deadline. These will
not be published in the ACM DL, and will only appear on the website.

The address of the submission site is: https://vmil25.hotcrp.com

All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE), i.e. GMT/UTC−12:00 hour

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE**: The official publication date is the date the proceedings
  are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two
  weeks before the first day of your conference. The official publication date
  affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

Submission formats
==========

- **Research and experience papers**: 6-10 pages, double-column, maximum 10pp, excluding references.
- **Work-in-progress and position papers**: up to 6 pages, double-column, maximum 10pp, but we will consider shorter submissions (e.g. a well-written2-page abstract).

Please use the SIGPLAN acmart style (`sigplan` option) for all papers:
https://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format. The provided double-column
template is available for Latex and Word.
