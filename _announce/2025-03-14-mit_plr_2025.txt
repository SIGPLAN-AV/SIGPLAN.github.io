# MIT Programming Languages Review Workshop 2025! 

Join us for this year’s annual MIT PLR workshop 2025 on **April 25th**! Attendance can be virtually or in-person on MIT campus.

This year, we’re excited to present a fresh lineup of talks from authors of what the PLR committee expects to be high-impact, significant works published in recent years at venues including: **OOPLSA, ASPLOS, PLDI, ICFP, PLDI, and more**! We will also be featuring an exciting **“Mixture of Experts” Panel**, featuring experts of various domains discussing their experience applying programming languages tools and techniques across fields.

The MIT PLR is a student-run committee, launched in 2023, that hopes to highlight recent developments that we believe have significant potential to shape the future direction of PL research and/or industry practice. We aim to select papers that may substantially transform the PL community and beyond, with a focus on emerging trends rather than established lines of research.

You can check out our full program on our [website](plr.csail.mit.edu) and register [here](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3aR7xGFs4fYigg6)! We hope to see you there!
