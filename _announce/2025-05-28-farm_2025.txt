========================================================================

FARM 2025 is the 13th edition of the ACM SIGPLAN International
Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design (FARM).

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft, and design,
including textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs,
video games, 3D printing and architectural models, choreography,
poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop.

In addition to the main workshop, FARM hosts a traditional evening of
performances. This year, the performance evening is sponsored and
hosted by both ICFP and SPLASH, and open to all attendees of either
conference. For this year, the venue for performances will be on the
University of Singapore Campus. See our call for papers for more
information on submitting a performance.

Call for Papers, Performances, and Demos
========================================

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) encourages submissions from across art,
craft, and design, including textiles, visual art, music, 3D
sculpture, animation, GUIs, video games, 3D printing and architectural
models, choreography, poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU
configurations, or mechanical engineering designs. Theoretical
foundations, language design, implementation issues, and applications
in industry or the arts are all within the scope of the workshop.

In addition to the main workshop, FARM hosts a traditional evening of
performances. Thus, this call encompasses both papers/demos for the
workshop (and its published proceedings) as well as performance
proposals for the evening’s event. Authors are invited to make a
single submission for each. Authors may submit both a paper/demo and
performance proposal, but the submissions will be considered
independently. Performances may be of previously-produced work, and
may be in any medium (including traditional acoustic performances) so
long as the principles of programming (or actual programs) were used
in their composition or performance.

Papers
======

Paper submissions are invited in three categories:

- Original research
- Overview / state of the art
- Technology tutorial (especially tools and environments for
  distributed artistic workflow)

Papers must be submitted via HotCRP, and meet the following requirements:

- 5 to 12 pages
- PDF format
- Adhere to the ACM SIGPLAN template

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part
of the FARM 2023 proceedings.

Authors are encouraged to submit auxiliary material for publication
along with their paper (source code, data, videos, images,
etc.). Authors retain all rights to the auxiliary material.

Demos
=====

Demo submissions should describe a demonstration and its context,
connecting it with the themes of FARM. A demo could be in the form of
a short (10 to 20 minute) tutorial, a presentation of work in
progress, an exhibition of some work, or even a performance.

Demos must be submitted via HotCRP, and meet the following requirements:

- 500 to 2000 words
- Have a title starting with “Demo: ”
- PDF format
- Adhere to the ACM SIGPLAN template

Accepted demos will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of
the FARM 2023 proceedings.

Performances
============

FARM seeks proposals for performances which employ programming
techniques (or are generated by programs), in whole or in part. We
invite a diverse range of functionally-themed submissions including
music, video, dance, and performance art. Both live performances and
fixed-media submissions are welcome. We encourage risk-taking
proposals that push forward the state of the art as well as refined
presentations of highly developed practice. In either case, please
support your submission with a clear description of your performance,
including how your performance employs functional programming and a
discussion of influences and prior art as appropriate. If desired, you
may use some of your performance time for a short lecture or
presentation; this must supplement, and not take the place of, a
primary performance.

Performance proposals should be emailed to
performance@functional-art.org or submitted via HotCRP, and must
include:

- A description of the performance (please be as specific as possible)
- An explanation of the use of programming in the work
- A list of technical requirements
- A link to an audio or video example (YouTube, Vimeo, Bandcamp, etc.)

Accepted performances will be presented at the performance evening.

Notes on funding
----------------

Paid registration to the FARM workshop is usually required for paper
and demo submitters, but will be waived for performers.

If you have financial difficulty attending, you can apply for the PAC
funds. Please get in touch for more information.
