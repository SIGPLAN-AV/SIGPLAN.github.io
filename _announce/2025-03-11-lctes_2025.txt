Dear Colleagues,

We would like to bring your attention to the call for papers for the 26th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES 2025). LCTES 2025 will be held in Seoul, South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· from June 16 to 17, 2025, co-located with PLDI 2025.

We enthusiastically look forward to your submissions on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming technical challenges in embedded systems and their emerging applications. Our sincere apologies if you receive multiple copies of this message.

## About the Conference

LCTES provides a link between the programming languages and embedded systems engineering communities. Researchers and developers in these areas are addressing many similar problems but with different backgrounds and approaches. LCTES is intended to expose researchers and developers from either area to relevant work and interesting problems in the other area and provide a forum where they can interact. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications.

## Important Dates

- Abstract Submission: <s>March 7, 2025</s> March 14, 2025 (soft, open until March 21)
- Paper Submission: <s>March 14, 2025</s> March 21, 2025
- Paper Notification: April 21, 2025
- Artifact Evaluation Submission: April 28, 2025
- Artifact Evaluation Notification: May 9, 2025
- Camera-Ready Submission: May 12, 2025
- Conference Dates: June 16-17, 2025

(All times are UTC-12, or "anywhere on earth", unless otherwise stated.)


## Paper Categories

- Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work (at most 2 additional pages for references and appendix)

- Poster, work-in-progress and invited paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions

Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, there will be Distinguished Paper awards selected from accepted papers to recognize the outstanding work among all papers.
