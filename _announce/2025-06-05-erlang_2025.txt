24th Edition of the Erlang Workshop 
Sunday 12th of October 2025, Singapore
A satellite workshop of ICFP 2025

https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/erlang-2025

 ** Abstract Registration Deadline: 6 June 2025 **

  ** Submission Deadline: 13 June 2025 **


The Erlang Workshop aims to bring together the open source, academic,
and industrial communities of Erlang-like languages (e.g., Elixir, Gleam, Erlang, Akka, Clojure),
including the concurrent, distributed systems, and fault-tolerant communities.
 
The workshop will enable participants to familiarize themselves with
recent developments on new techniques and tools, novel applications,
draw lessons from users' experiences and identify research problems
and common areas relevant to the practice of Erlang, Erlang-like
languages, functional programming, distribution, concurrency etc.

## Topics

This year we invite three types of submissions:

* Technical papers describing language extensions, critical
  discussions of the status quo, formal semantics of language
  constructs, program analysis and transformation, virtual machine
  extensions and compilation techniques, implementations and
  interfaces of Erlang in/with other languages, and new tools
  (profilers, tracers, debuggers, testing frameworks, etc.).
  Submission related to Erlang, Elixir, Lisp Flavored Erlang, and
  topics in functional, concurrent, and distributed programming 
  are welcome and encouraged. The maximum length for technical papers is
  restricted to 12 pages, but short papers (max. 6 pages) are also
  welcome.

* Practice and application papers describing uses of Erlang and
  related languages in the “real-world”, libraries for specific tasks,
  experiences from using Erlang in specific application domains,
  reusable programming idioms and elegant new ways of using Erlang to
  approach or solve particular problems, etc. The maximum length for
  the practice and application papers is restricted to 12 pages, but
  short papers (max. 6 pages) are also welcome.

* Lightning talks describing topics related to the workshop goals that
  allow participants to present and demonstrate projects and
  preliminary work in academia and industry.  Presentations in this
  category will be given at most an hour of shared simultaneous
  presentation time, will not be part of the peer review process and
  will not be part of the formal proceedings.  Notification of
  acceptance will be continuous.

## Instructions to authors

### Submission

Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN’s republication policy
(http://sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/), and authors
should be aware of ACM’s policies on plagiarism
(https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism).  Program
Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but their papers will
be held to a higher standard.

Papers must be submitted online via HotCRP at:

https://erlang2025.hotcrp.com

Lightning talks can be submitted to the workshop's co-chairs via e-mail.

### Formatting

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),
formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines.  Authors should use
the `acmart` format, with the `sigplan` sub-format for ACM
proceedings.  For details, see:

http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format

It is recommended to use the `review` option when submitting a paper;
this option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.

### Supplementary material

Authors have the option to attach supplementary material to a
submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look
at it.  This supplementary material should not be submitted as part of
the main document; instead, it should be uploaded as a separate PDF
document or tarball.

Supplementary material should be uploaded at submission time, not by
providing a URL in the paper that points to an external repository.

### Artifacts

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make auxiliary material
(artifacts like source code, test data, etc.) available with their
paper.  They can opt to have these artifacts published alongside their
paper in the ACM Digital Library (copyright of artifacts remains with
the authors).

If an accepted paper’s artifacts are made permanently available for
retrieval in a publicly accessible archival repository like the ACM
Digital Library, that paper qualifies for an Artifacts Available badge
(https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging#available).
Applications for such a badge can be made after paper acceptance and
will be reviewed by the PC co-chairs.

## Proceedings

As with previous years, the accepted workshop papers will be published
by the ACM and will appear in the ACM Digital Library.


AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:
The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. 
This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the 
deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

For more information, please see ACM Copyright Policy
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy) and ACM
Author Rights (http://authors.acm.org/main.html).

Accepted lightning talks will be posted on the workshop's website but
not formally published in the proceedings.
