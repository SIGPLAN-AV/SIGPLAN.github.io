title: "John C. Reynolds Doctoral Dissertation Award"
---

Presented annually to the author of an outstanding doctoral
dissertation in the area of Programming Languages. The award includes
a prize of $1,000. The awardee can choose to receive the award at
ICFP, SPLASH, POPL, or PLDI. At the discretion of the Selection
Committee, multiple awards and/or honorable mentions may be presented
for a given year.

The Reynolds Dissertation Award recognizes the contributions to
computer science that John C. Reynolds made during his life. It is a
renaming of the SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award to
encourage the clarity and rigor that Reynolds embodied and at the same
time provides a reminder of Reynolds's legacy and the difference a
person can make in the field of programming language research.

Reynolds is renowned for his many technical contributions.

 * Gedanken, a core untyped language mixing functional and imperative features, which influenced Scheme;
 * Defunctionalization, which gives principled ways of constructing compilers;
 * Polymorphic λ-calculus, a fundamental calculus of polymorphic functions, which influenced Java and C# generics;
 * Syntactic control of interference, a resource-oriented type system, which prefigured linear logic;
 * λ-calculus with subtypes, which is a foundational component of object-oriented type systems;
 * Idealized Algol, a core typed language for mixing imperative and functional features, which prefigured monads in Haskell;
 * Possible-world semantics for local state, a widely-used technique in programming language theory;
 * Relational parametricity, a fundamental theory of data abstraction;
 * Separation logic, an extension of Hoare logic to mutable data structures, which forms the basis of a new generation of proof tools.

Reynolds was an inspiration to all he worked with. He was well known
for helping colleagues and students work through ideas. But his
influence went well beyond his immediate circle; many researchers who
never worked with Reynolds nevertheless built on his ideas.

All questions about the John C. Reynolds Doctoral Dissertation Award
should be directed to the SIGPLAN Awards co-Chairs.

#### Nominations

Nominations can be submitted at any time using the Web form at
<https://awards.sigplan.org/nominate/reynolds/>. Nominations submitted
on or before January 15th will be considered for award that year.  The
nominated dissertation must have been submitted for award of the
doctoral degree in the year prior to the nomination deadline, and be
available in English (to facilitate evaluation by the selection
committee).

#### Committee

Recipients are selected by a committee constituted as follows:
* The Chair of the committee shall be a member of the SIGPLAN
  Executive Committee (EC), and shall be appointed by the executive
  committee.
* The SIGPLAN EC Chair shall be an ex-officio member of the committee.
  If the SIGPLAN EC Chair is unable to serve, he or she may appoint
  another member of the SIGPLAN EC as a substitute.
* The steering committees of the major SIGPLAN Conferences, POPL,
  PLDI, ICFP, and SPLASH, shall each appoint a member to the
  committee.

The current committee is:
* [Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html), Cornell U (Chair)
* [Andrew Myers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/), Cornell U (ex-officio)
* [Loris D'Antoni](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ldantoni/), UCSD (SPLASH)
* [Santosh Nagarakette](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~santosh.nagarakatte/), Rutgers U (PLDI)
* [Umut Acar](https://www.umut-acar.org/), Carnegie Mellon U (ICFP)
* [Michael Greenberg](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/mgreenbe), Stevens (POPL)

#### Conflicts of Interest

If any member of the committee has a conflict of interest with a given
nominee they shall declare that to the committee; once so declared,
conflicts of interest shall not automatically prevent a committee
member from taking part in the selection process. However, if a member
of the committee, or the chair of the committee, feels that the
association of a committee member with a nominee would interfere with
impartial consideration of the nominees, that conflicted member shall
be absented from the relevant parts of the discussion. If a committee
member has conflicts of interest with more than one nominee, the Chair
of the Committee may ask the constituency that appointed the committee
member to select a replacement member.  The SIGPLAN EC Chair will
adjudicate as necessary.
